### Functionality:
<p>
  This program takes the base consumption by taking the current records of your electricity bill
  and subtracting it to the previous record (if you have already set the record otherwise it is set 
  to 0 by default) and then calculates the total bill to be payed by multiplying the base consumption with the predetermined rates (generation, transmission, system loss, etc.). The program stores all data inside 2 .csv files, one is for the general information of the user, and the
  other one is for their records (which will be named after their ID).
